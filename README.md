Nancy is a simple tool to help you stay in touch with people.

## Overview
Create an account with Nancy. Now you can set reminders to contact a person that will be emailed to you daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, trimonthly, or annually. That's it. Dead simple way to remember to stay in touch with people.

For example:
I met Steve R. at an event yesterday an want to reach out to him in a month. Set a reminder to reach out to Steve at steve@company.com in one month. In a month Nancy will email you a reminder.
