# Nancy

Nancy is a simple tool to help you stay in touch with people.

## Overview
Create an account with Nancy. Now you can set reminders to contact a person that will be emailed to you daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, trimonthly, or annually. That's it. Dead simple way to remember to stay in touch with people.

For example:
Say I meet "John Smith" at an event last night. I enjoyed the conversation and think he would be a good person to stay in touch with on a regular basis. I set a reminder to reach out to "John S" at "john@company.com"  monthly. In a month Nancy will email me a reminder. A month after that Nancy will email again. Etcâ€¦
